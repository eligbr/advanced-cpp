An experienced engineer should be familiar with the following concepts and features of C++:

- Object-oriented programming concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Templates and generic programming.
- The Standard Template Library (STL), including containers (such as vectors, lists, and maps) and algorithms (such as sort, find, and transform).
- Exception handling.
- Memory management, including the use of smart pointers and the differences between stack and heap allocation.
- The C++11, C++14, and C++17 language standards and their new features, such as move semantics, lambda expressions, and auto type deduction.
- Best practices for writing efficient, maintainable, and readable code, such as the SOLID principles and design patterns.
- Debugging and optimization techniques, including the use of a debugger and profiling tools.
- Interfacing with C code and using external libraries.
- Concurrency and multithreading, including the use of the C++11 threads library and atomic operations.
